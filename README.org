* My Twitter and Storm Playground

This project is a prototyping bed for real-time NLP work against the
twitter firehose.  It is designed to support Java, Clojure, Python,
Ruby, and Javascript as components within Storm topologies.  As I
build this framework out, please feel free to fork it and adapt it to
your needs.
